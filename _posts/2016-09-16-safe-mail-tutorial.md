An example of an email app skeleton to allow developers to pick it up and add some basic functionality for a fully working email MVP. Then add further functionality using the APIs described in this tutorial, to make amazing communication tools in SAFE. We have tried very hard to not make a user-facing app as we want developers to see this as a tutorial and know they have everything they need for communications apps in SAFE and a bit more.

A first stage of the tutorial series and we hope you enjoy it and help us clean up any bugs (this was done extremely quickly) and help improve the SAFE Launcher APIs.

Learn how to build **an email app that works entirely on the SAFE Network**!

Instead of relying on an email service provider such as Gmail, or going through the trouble of running your own mail server, you can use the SAFE Network to build dynamic applications such as email and messaging apps.
