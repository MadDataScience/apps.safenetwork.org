## SafeEditor MVP, edit your safe files directly from your browser

[SafeEditor](http://safeeditor.davidmtl.safenet/#) (alpha network) is a safesite that allows you to edit your Safe APP files directly from your browser (tested in Chrome and Firefox).

### How it works

- The editor needs to pretend it is another APP in order to access their files. Enter the information of the SAFE app you want to access. For convenience I default to SAFE Demo App, this allows you to edit any file you uploaded using the demo app, this include your safesites.
- Press the "authorize" button.
- Now you can create, edit, and delete your files and folders as you wish.
